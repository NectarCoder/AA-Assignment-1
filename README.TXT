## Run Program

Ensure Python 3.12 or higher is installed.  

Open a terminal window and change directories to this project. Enter the following command:  
`python .\StableMatching.py <inputfile>`  

Input files can be found under the MatchingInput folder. For instance if you want to use the `input_2.txt` file as an input run the following command:  
`python .\StableMatching.py .\MatchingInput\input_2.txt`

Pre-generated output file can be found under the MatchingOutputPre folder. Running the command for a specific input file will auto generate an output file of format `output_x.txt` will be saved in the MatchingOutput folder.  
For instance if `input_2.txt` is used than `output_2.txt` will be generated.
